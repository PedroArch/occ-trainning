/**
 * This is the entry point for the server-side extension.
 * 
 * This code is using the ECMAScript features supported
 * in the version 6.11.3 of NodeJS (Present in OCC 17.6.3.1).
 * 
 * To check which ECMAScript features you can use,
 * my suggestion is to get the NodeJS version from the OCC environment
 * you are working now. To do so, you can make a GET request
 * to "/ccadminx/v1/versions".
 * 
 * With the version, access https://node.green/ and check which
 * features you can use.
 * 
 * Also, you can set your local environment to use the same NodeJS version
 * to make the development as closest possible with the OCC extension server.
 * 
 * Cheers ;)
